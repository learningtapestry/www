            of how your data comes into our system, we will treat it carefully,
            preserving your privacy according to the rules laid out in this
            document, and to the best of our ability.

              <p style="margin-bottom: 28px">
                We use the information we collect from all of our services first
                and foremost to provide information to our customers and
                partners to help them provide services based on the information.
                We also use the information to provide, maintain, protect and
                improve the services we offer as well as to develop new
                services, to keep our system running effectively and to protect
                Learning Tapestry and our users.
              </p>
              <p>
                We will never sell information provided by, or about, our
                customers or partners to anyone.
              </p>
              <p>
                We may share information about our customers or partners with
                partners for purposes of delivering our services. For example,
                we might share information about specific users to a data
                analytics partner who can analyze this information to provide
                predictions about the services a user might need (this is
                sometimes called "predictive analytics" or "collaborative
                filtering"). In cases where we do share information in this way
                to partners, we will ensure that the partner is bound by the
                same or similar privacy agreement as this one, so that your
                information cannot be used by that organization in a way that is
                different from how we use it, as described in <br />
                this privacy policy.
              </p>
              <p>
                We may use the name you provide for your Learning Tapestry
                Profile across all of the services we offer that require a
                Learning Tapestry Account. In addition, we may replace past
                names associated with your Learning Tapestry Account so that you
                are represented consistently across all our services. If other
                users already have your email, or other information that
                identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Learning
                Tapestry Profile information, such as your name and photo. When
                you contact Learning Tapestry, we may keep a record of your
                communication to help solve any issues you might be facing. We
                may use your email address to inform you about our services,
                such as letting you know about upcoming changes or improvements,

                your user experience and the overall quality of our services.
                For example, we may track a website you visit and some

              <p>
                People have different privacy concerns. Our goal is to be clear
                about what information we collect, so that you can make
                meaningful choices about how it is used. In some cases your
                information may be managed by a third party such as school or
                learning company. In those cases, your control over the use of
                your data at Learning Tapestry may be the responsibility of that
                third party. We will always do our best to help you work with
                that third party to manage your information. In all cases where
                it applies, we will follow FERPA and other privacy and data use
                regulations.

                We always aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects
                information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of
                this, after you delete information from our services, we may not
                immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and
                may not remove information from our backup systems, but we will
                still follow this Privacy Policy when managing those residual
