              product or service provided by the Learning Tapestry that cannot
              be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved
              by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of
              this Section 8.2. Unless otherwise agreed to, all arbitration
              proceedings shall be held in English. This Section 8.2 applies to
              you and the Learning Tapestry, and to any subsidiaries,
              affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest,
              successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized
              users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the

              <em>(b) Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution. </em
              >Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first
              send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute
              <strong>(“Notice”)</strong> describing the nature and basis of the
              claim or dispute, and the requested relief. A Notice to the
              Learning Tapestry should be sent to the address indicated at the
              end of these Terms. After the Notice is received, you and the
              Learning Tapestry may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute
              informally. If you and the Learning Tapestry do not resolve the
              claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is
              received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding. The
              amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be
              disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has
              determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party
              is entitled.
            </p>
            <p class="indent-lg">
              <em>(c) Arbitration Rules. </em>Arbitration shall be initiated
              through the American Arbitration Association
              <strong>(“AAA”)</strong>, an established alternative dispute
              resolution provider <strong>(“ADR Provider”)</strong> that offers
              arbitration as set forth in this section. If AAA is not available
              to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR
              Provider. The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects
              of the arbitration, including but not limited to the method of
              initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such
              rules are in conflict with the Terms. The AAA Consumer Arbitration
              Rules <strong>(“Arbitration Rules”)</strong> governing the
              arbitration are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the
              AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration shall be conducted by a
              single, neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total
              amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars
              (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding
              non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party
              seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount of
              the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or
              more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration
              Rules. Any hearing will be held in a location within Alameda
              County, California, U.S.A. Any judgment on the award rendered by
              the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent
              jurisdiction. Each party shall bear its own costs (including
              attorney’s fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration
              and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR
              Provider.

              shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on
              written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the
              party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not
              involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless
              otherwise agreed by the parties.
            </p>
            <p class="indent-lg">
              <em>(e) Time Limits. </em>If you or the Learning Tapestry pursue
              arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or
              demanded within the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal
              deadline for filing a claim) and within any deadline imposed under
              the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.
            </p>

              <em>(f) Authority of Arbitrator. </em>If arbitration is initiated,
              the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of
              you and the Learning Tapestry, and the dispute will not be
              consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases
              or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant
              motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator
              shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant
              any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under
              applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall
              issue a written award and statement of decision describing the
              essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based,
              including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator
              has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that
              a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator
              is final and binding upon you and the Learning Tapestry.
