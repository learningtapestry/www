              your information, including any personally identifiable
              information or other data collected that could directly or
              indirectly identify you (“Personal Data”) when you access our

            </p>
            <p>
              Each time you use our App, you consent to the collection, use and

            <h3><a name="anchor1"></a>1. What information do we collect</h3>

            <p>
              <strong>Registration, Profile and Payment Information.</strong>
              At this moment, our App does not provide any features allowing you
              to create an account, a profile or make a payment. We will not be
              collecting any data relating to those activities.

              <strong>Automatically Collected Online Usage Activity.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              As is true of most applications, we gather certain information
              automatically when you use our App. When you use our App, we may
              collect certain information automatically from you, which may
              include mobile device ID and usage information, such as your

            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>App and Customer Support.</strong> When you reach out to
              us for customer support, we may collect information such as your
              name and email address to provide such support.
            </p>

            <h3>
              <a name="anchor2"></a>2. How do we use the collected information?
            </h3>

            <p>
              We use the information we collect for the purposes described in
              this Privacy Policy, as covered in any agreement that incorporates
              this Privacy Policy, or as disclosed to you in connection with our
              App. For example, we will use your information to:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Provide and deliver the App;</li>
              <li>
                Operate and improve our operations, systems, products, and App;
              </li>
              <li>
                Provide customer and service support, such as sending
                confirmations and other administrative messages;
              </li>
              <li>
                Enforce our terms and conditions or protect our business,
                partners, or users; or
              </li>

              (through IP addresses), browser and device characteristics and
              language preferences. This research may be compiled and analyzed
              on an aggregate basis and this aggregate information does not
              identify you personally and will not be treated as Personal Data
              under this Privacy Policy.
            </p>

            <p>

            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Provide our service to you: Most of the time, the reason we
                process your information is to perform the contract that you
                have with us. For example, if you email us to request for
                customer support, we will use your email to communicate with you
                and provide such support.
              </li>
              <li>
                Legitimate interests: We may use your information where we have
                legitimate interests to do so. We analyze aggregated and/or
                anonymous user activities on our App to continuously improve our
                App and for market research purposes. We process information for
                administrative, fraud detection and other legal purposes.

            <p>
              Our App does not collect personal information from children under

              GDPR counterparts?
            </h3>
            <p>
              If you are located in countries that are within the European

            <p>
              Sharing of information laid out in Section 3 sometimes involves
              cross-border data transfers, for instance to the United States of
              America and other jurisdictions. Learning Tapestry may also
              subcontract processing to, or share your Personal Data with, third
              parties located in countries other than your home country. Your

              different from those in your country of residence.
            </p>
            <p>
              We may store the Personal Data on servers hosted by Amazon Web
              Services (AWS). Like Learning Tapestry, helping to protect the
              confidentiality, integrity, and availability of customer data is
              of the utmost importance to AWS, as is maintaining customer trust
              and confidence. For more details of AWS’ privacy and security

              applicable privacy laws and, in particular, that appropriate

              Policy?
            </h3>
            <p>
              We have implemented reasonable administrative, technical and
              physical security measures to protect your personal information
              against unauthorized access, destruction or alteration. For
              example, we limit access to this information to authorized
              employees and contractors who need to know that information in
              order to operate, develop or improve our App. All sensitive
              information is protected behind firewalls and multiple layers of
              security systems. However, although we endeavor to provide
              reasonable security for information we process and maintain, no
              security system can ever be 100% secure.

              <a name="anchor9"></a>9. How Does Learning Tapestry Respond to “Do
              Not Track” Signals?
            </h3>
            <p>
              “Do Not Track” is a feature enabled on some browsers that sends a
              signal to request that a web application disable its tracking or
              cross-site user tracking. At present, Learning Tapestry does not
              respond to or alter its practices when a Do Not Track signal is
              received.
